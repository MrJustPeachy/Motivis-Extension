# Motivis-Extension
Welcome to the Motivis-Extension project! The purpose of this chrome extension is to allow for a greater connectivity among apprentices in the CareerWise Colorado program. Since the bootcamp is over, networking and connecting are difficult since there is no easy way to find contact information and other social media links. 

Concept figures showcasing my idea will be added here soon. I want this to be a learning experience for everyone involved, so feel free to constribute and expand the project.

## Phase 1 ##
I'm going to develop a hard-coded example of what I imagine will show up on everyone's profile. This has been accomplished and Phase 2 is now in development.

## Phase 2 ##
Phase 2 is to make this extension customizable so everyone has their own unique links to their respective social media links. There are a few things that need to be changed in order for this to work:

-- Hard code in (not ideal, but secure until better solution is thought of) the links of whoever wants them.

-- Any social media links that aren't put in shouldn't show up on the person's profile.

### Future expansion ideas ###
A few ideas on how to extend the extensions capabilities:

-- Change the background image to a customizable image.

-- Have a report feature so innapropriate content gets taken down.

-- There needs to be an options page to edit the links easily for any given profile (need to figure out how to secure this page).
