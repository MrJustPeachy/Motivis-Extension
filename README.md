# Motivis-Extension
Welcome to the Motivis-Extension project! THe purpose of this chrome extension is to allow for a greater connectivity among apprentices in the CareerWise Colorado program. Since the bootcamp is over, networking and connecting are difficult since there is no easy way to find contact information and other social media links. 

Concept figures showcasing my idea will be added here soon. I want this to be a learning experience for everyone involved, so feel free to constribute and expand the project.
